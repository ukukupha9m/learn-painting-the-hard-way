Dedication
----------

This course is dedicated to Ana.  I took my first drawing class with her, and because of her encouragement I stuck with it.  Without her I would have never discovered painting and the happiness it gives me every day.

I also dedicate this course to all the weird little kids who wanted to make art but were told that nerds, dorks, and logical people can't be creative.  I'm a programmer who writes courses teaching other people how to code and thinks Bob Ross is a genius.  It really does not get more nerd, dork, and logical than me.  So if I can paint, then you can too.

Getting Started
---------------

This course is written in a way that makes it possible for people with various limitations to learn to paint.  I've taken great care and thought in devising these exercises so that people with physical, emotional, economic, or time limitations can still use them.  The course is free to download, does not require crazy setups or materials, uses the cheapest safest materials possible, and comes with high quality photographic reference for you to freely use.  This section will lay out the goals and describe who will benefit the most from the course.

Pastels
-------

I chose pastels for this course because they are cheap, work really well, work like other painting mediums, and are generally the safest and easiest to use.  If you learn to use pastels then it's fairly easy to transition into oil paints, charcoal, pencils, and acrylic.  Watercolor is a whole other beast but the things you learn with pastels will apply.  In this section I describe the things you need to get for the first section, how to be safe with them, and how to get the photos I've taken for the course.  I also briefly talk about why I use photos, and some criticisms and limitations of using photos.

Monochrome Painting
-------------------

Nothing in this course is revolutionary or new.  Most of these exercises and techniques have been around since about 1500 AD and possibly even sooner.  The only thing I've done is collected them into a logical sequence that starts you off slow and gradually builds up your skill.  The first step in being able to paint what you see is being able to draw in monochrome.  By first doing monochrome drawings you remove the problem of color from what you need to learn and simplify your task.  It's then possible to add color to your paintings in the next phase of your studies.  This section will give you some terms used in drawing, talk about a few common strategies for drawing, and then discuss how you'll use pastels to "draw like a painter" and why that matters.  If you are color blind then you can do *all* of this course in monochrome and never bother with color at all.  In fact, you might be very good at drawing.

* [Exercise 06: Applying Pastels](ex06-applying-pastels/)
* [Exercise 07: The Second Statement](ex07-the-second-statement/)

Simple Monochrome Shapes
------------------------

The first exercises are all about learning how to render very simple shapes in 3 or 5 values.  I am using a collection of simple foam blocks I bought online to practice.  You don't have to buy them, as I've taken photos for you to use instead.  If you want an extra challenge then you can buy the foam blocks and also paint from them.  The videos that accompany this section will go very slow in the most boring way possible so that you can see exactly how I'm doing what I do.  This section is more about getting used to working with pastels than learning to draw little cubes.

* [Exercise 09: A Cube in 5 Values](ex09-a-cube-in-5-values/)

* [Exercise 11: A Sphere With Blending](ex11-a-sphere-with-blending/)
* [Exercise 12: Multiple Simple Shapes](ex12-multiple-simple-shapes/)

Monochrome Still Life Studies
-----------------------------

You will now start to do monochrome paintings of random things in your house.  I've created exercises for a group of subjects that get gradually more difficult, and I've provided photos for you to use in your studies.  This means you don't have to own any of these things to learn to draw them.  Once you you've completed these studies you can try to do paintings of anything you have laying around your house.

* [Exercise 21: Still Life of Apples, Grapes, Seashells](ex21-still-life-of-apples-grapes-seashells/)

Monochrome Texture Studies
--------------------------

You will now practice monochrome paintings of different textured items.  Chances are your paintings will only look a *little* like the subjects, but attempt them anyway as we'll revisit these later when we discover color.  As usual, I've provided you with photos to do your initial studies with, and then you can try to use real objects you have.

* [Exercise 26: A Glass of Water](ex26-a-glass-of-water/)
* [Exercise 27: A Plastic Jug of Water](ex27-a-plastic-jug-of-water/)

Monochrome Advanced Studies
---------------------------

The final projects in the monochrome painting phase of study are meant to be advanced topics to give you a final push in your learning.  You'll attempt an interior, which just means your bedroom, a kitchen, a bathroom, etc.  You'll then attempt a portrait of an old lady plaster cast, and one of a young girl.  Your goal with these studies is not to be overly accurate, but to get as close as you can.  With the casts you most likely won't be able to get them, so I've provided many photos of them from various angles.  After this, you should do as much monochrome painting as you possibly can as you continue on with the course.

* [Exercise 29: An Old Lady Cast](ex29-an-old-lady-cast/)
* [Exercise 30: A Young Girl Cast](ex30-a-young-girl-cast/)


Introducing Color
-----------------

You now move into using color, which in pastels is both very easy, and kind of difficult.  What makes color in pastels easy is there's no mixing or guessing.  You just pick up the color and use it.  What makes pastels difficult is there's no mixing, so if you don't have a stick for a color you see then you have to "interpret" the color and try to get close.  In this section you'll find out what pastels to get, learn about terminology, and learn a few techniques that makes using color pastels easier.

* [Exercise 31: Gearing Up for Color Pastels](ex31-gearing-up-for-color-pastels/)
* [Exercise 32: Color Terminology](ex32-color-terminology/)
* [Exercise 33: Color and Pastels](ex33-color-and-pastels/)
* [Exercise 34: Applying Color with Pastels](ex34-applying-color-with-pastels/)
* [Exercise 35: Blending Color Pastels](ex35-blending-color-pastels/)
* [Exercise 36: Lighting and Setup for Color Study](ex36-lighting-and-setup-for-color-study/)


Color Still Life Studies
------------------------

You then start at the beginning and do your original still life studies but using color instead of monochrome.  You will learn to select your set of colors before you start, get a basic drawing down in an "under painting", and then render the color as best you can.

* [Exercise 37: Oranges and Apples](ex37-oranges-and-apples/)
* [Exercise 38: Sea Shells](ex38-sea-shells/)
* [Exercise 39: Still Life of Oranges, Apples and Seashells](ex39-still-life-of-oranges-apples-and-seashells/)
* [Exercise 40: Celery and Onions](ex40-celery-and-onions/)
* [Exercise 41: My Blue Guitar Deconstructed](ex41-my-blue-guitar-deconstructed/)

Color Texture Studies
---------------------

You then move on to studying textures again, but with color this becomes much easier.  In fact, your goal in this section is to try not to do too much in your attempt to create the effect of each texture.  With pastels you could slave over each subject and render out every tiny hair on a teddy bear, but that's not the point.  The point is to do more with less.  Don't assume that your viewer is an idiot and leave something for them to ponder.

* [Exercise 43: Teddy Bear](ex43-teddy-bear/)
* [Exercise 44: My Little Paint Box](ex44-my-little-paint-box/)

* [Exercise 46: A Plastic Jug of Water](ex46-a-plastic-jug-of-water/)
* [Exercise 47: A Glass of Water on Color Paper](ex47-a-glass-of-water-on-color-paper/)

Color Advanced Studies
----------------------

You now get into the fun final projects that are entire genres of painting all on their own.  I will go through these final projects, and also provide you with lists of other books that will help you learn more about them if you want to dive deep into them.  I will also include many landscapes by myself and other artists which you can copy.  Copying other artists is a very solid way to learn how to paint and get better.

* [Exercise 48: A Landscape](ex48-a-landscape/)
* [Exercise 49: An Interior](ex49-an-interior/)
* [Exercise 50: A Self-portrait](ex50-a-self/)
* [Exercise 51: A Fish](ex51-a-fish/)

The End?
--------

In the end I'll lay out ideas for more pastel subjects, talk to you about oils and watercolor, and then give you some final words of advice on making art for your own enjoyment.
