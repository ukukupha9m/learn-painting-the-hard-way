Exercise 04: Overview of Drawing Strategies
===========================================

In this book I'm going to use a simplified style of drawing that works fairly well when painting, but I'm going to give small demonstrations of other drawing styles in this exercise.  Each of the drawing styles I demonstrate are useful in different ways, but you might see one that really works for you.  If you feel like trying one then go for it.  I say there is no one perfect way to draw, as each style has advantages and disadvantages.

For this exercise you should watch the video because words simply can't describe how to draw very well.

Sight-Sized Style
-----------------

In this style of drawing you place your piece of paper (the ground) right next to what you want to paint.  You then simply compare your drawing directly to the subject and take all of your measurements directly.  This makes it easier to find errors and draw, but it's not useful in situations where you can't have full control of the subject.

Unit-Sized Style
----------------

Unit-sized drawing is where you measure a small part of the subject that is very consistent.  If you were drawing a human face you could use the space between the eyes.  This distance doesn't change much as the head moves around, so it's reliable.  You then *compare* everything else in the drawing to this one consistent measurement.  You find the size of the left eye by measuring your unit, and then seeing how many units make up the eye.  You find out how tall the head is by measuring your unit again, and then counting how many units make up the head.  As long as you keep using this unit to measure everything it should come out accurately measured.

The main disadvantage of this style is that it doesn't place your measured shapes relative to each other very well.  Another way to say that is it doesn't help get the angles right.

Block Style
-----------

Block style is where you start with a big block outline of the thing you want to draw, like you're piling a few planks of wood on top of it.  This creates a block of wood that you then "carve" out increasingly more complex pieces from this gross block until it looks like the object.  You start with a gross block, then add more lines to break that block, then add lines inside for more complexity.  As you work you keep your proportions right and slowly you have an accurate drawing.

The main disadvantage of this style in painting is it's difficult to draw tons of lines on your ground.  It takes a lot of "carving" and erasing and refining to get a good drawing, and that means you can't do it easily with paint.  The other problem is this style of drawing doesn't work well with whole scenes such as landscapes or rooms.  It works well on a single object, but when there isn't really a "single" object it doesn't work.

Painterly Style
---------------

Painterly style takes advantage of the fact that paint can put down a whole shape in one move without using lines.  In real life there are no lines.  Take a look around and you won't see a hard line between two things.  What you see are the edges of objects meeting, but no pencil line separates them.  In painterly style you paint big shapes that match the large shapes you see, and then you refine those shapes.  It is similar to the Block Style, but rather than using lines you simply paint the shape.  

This turns out to be easier and quicker than the other styles and works best with paint, so I'll use it *mostly* in this book.  This style works well with every subject, and you can also use it combined with Unit-Sized or Sight-Sized measurements as you need.  The biggest disadvantage in this style is that it can be hard to see shapes in more complex scenes and to place them right, so a *little* bit of drawing and measuring helps you place the shapes in the beginning.

Memory Drawing
--------------

There are two more styles of drawing that are not really intended to be ways to draw accurately but more ways to train your brain.  The first is drawing from memory.  This is where you spend time staring at your subject, trying to memorize the shapes, and then you put the shapes on your ground from memory.  This doesn't make a very accurate painting, but it trains the main thing that you need when painting.  One big aspect of painting is using your visual memory to hold in your head what you see, and then translate it to paint.  Practicing memory drawing is the best way to learn and improve this skill.

Contour Drawing
---------------

Contour drawing is the exact inverse of memory drawing.  In memory drawing you stop looking at your subject and try to remember everything you can.  In contour drawing you constantly look at what you're drawing, and keeping your pencil on the paper at all times, try to draw without looking at the paper...much.  Contour drawing forces you to do the most important thing in painting which is to look at your subject and study it.  What you draw never really comes out accurately, but you can actually get very close if you practice.

Exercise Assignment
-------------------

For this exercise you'll want to watch the video where I demonstrate each style of drawing on a tiny little study and then try them out for yourself.  I'll be using the painterly style, but I find that all the techniques come in handy for different situations.  As the course progresses I'll try different techniques and let you try them too.
