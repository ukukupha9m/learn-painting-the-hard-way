Exercise 08: The Third Statement
===============================

You have done a first statement using painterly drawing.  You've then melted the pastel to fix it or apply it the paper.  You then did your second statement to refine the painting further and fix any mistakes.  Now you are ready to do your third statement and finish the painting.  To do the third statement you are doing this:

1. Look inside your second statement shapes and see if you can further divide them again.
2. Use blending between second statement shapes to remove any edges that aren't really there.
3. Look for tiny details that you can add to increase the realism.
4. Correct anything you can, but keep in mind that correcting your painting in the third statement is very difficult so you may have to just live with it.

The third statement usually has no end and could take you a long time.  I suggest you give yourself a time limit of an hour so you don't obsess over this little cube longer than is necessary.  This course has plenty of other subjects you can practice on.  I'll also remind you to watch the video as the above description is so thin it's useless.  Watching me do this process is the best way to see what you need to do.

These Are Guesses
-----------------

I keep using the word "statement" because that's what artists like to call these.  I consider them guesses as to what it should look like, not statements.  Statements seem final and open to being proven wrong.  A guess is an exploration, a question, and a maybe.  A guess can totally be wrong and that's alright.  The trick to guessing what your painting should look like is that as you continue to make more guesses you eventually get closer to what you see.  The only difference between a painting that looks like a photo and a quick sketch that's not too close is time.  When it looks like a photo someone took the time to make a great many guesses (and also probably used photos like crazy but pretending they didn't).

Spotting Values
---------------

Your brain plays a trick on you when it sees values in context.  If you see a dark shape inside a light background your brain will think that dark shape is much darker than it really is.  The same is true if you put a light shape inside a dark background.  How dark or light something is depends on what's around it, but to paint it you have to remove the context to see it clearly.

The first trick for seeing it clearly is to slightly close your eyes about half way.  This turns your eyes and eye lashes into a kind of filter that reduces the amount of light coming into your eyes and makes what you see less complex.  For seeing values this helps you see only 3-4 values instead of all the possible ones.  Try this now on the photo.

The second trick is to remove the context using a hole.  I take my fist and I make a small hole with it and look through at a spot inside a shape.  Since it's dark inside my fist the context changes for that spot, which isn't too helpful.  Where it comes in handy is when I use *two* fists.  I look through two fists with two holes pointed at different parts of the photo and now those two parts have the same context.  Right away I can easily compare them to see if they are the same or different.

You can also do this last trick with a middle gray card with a small hole in it.  Take a piece of your paper and use your middle pastel to make it gray.  Melt the pastel and then punch a small hole in the little piece of paper.  You can then compare all the other parts of this photo against your middle gray to see if it's darker or lighter.  Make two pieces of paper and you can compare two parts.

This might lead you to one more trick you can use:  Use your pastels to make a strip of squares with each value of pastel you have.  Then, punch holes in each square.  You can then use this strip to find the best value for a shape in your photo.  You just look through each square's hole pointed at the shape until you get close, and then that's your value for that shape.

Exercise Assignment
-------------------

We are at the final stage of our first pastel painting of this lovely cube:

You're assignment is to now complete your third statement of the cube as well as you can.  You definitely should watch the video for this exercise to truly understand what I mean.  Painting is a visual activity so it's *infinitely* easier to watch someone do it than to read about how to do it.  You can *also* attempt to follow along with me and copy my pastel.  Copying someone else's painting is a very good way to learn how to paint.

Throw It Away
-------------

You are done with this drawing, and it's possibly your first drawing in pastels.  Congratulations!  Now I want you to take a photo of it and throw it in the garbage.  Just crumple it up and toss it.

Why?  Because it is just a study.  They should not be perfect.  They should be something you can throw away and try again.  If you treat these studies like they are precious you'll get hung up on making them perfect and that will prevent you from learning the important lesson at this point:  getting started.  Getting started is difficult, and one thing that gets in the way of the start is feeling like it should be perfect.

In the start, everything is flawed.  It takes time and multiple statements to get close to accurate, and even then your paintings will be a little off because you made them and you're human.  That's what makes them fun and interesting.

So toss that study out and start another one. Then throw that one away too.  Trust me, you'll do a lot of these little studies.
