Exercise 07: The Second Statement
=================================

Your pastel painting from Exercise 06 should be melted and dry.  You actually don't *have* to melt your pastels and can just do this exercise anyway.  When you only do two layers of pastels you have enough texture to make the pastel stick.  It's when you get to the 3rd and 4th layer of pastels where you run into trouble.  As you layer on more pastel you can't stick more and you knock off other layers.  The alcohol causes that first layer of pastel to not count against you and also act as a rough sandpaper for later layers.

Now you can do your second statement of the pastel painting.  In this step you are using your pastel to refine and correct your previous statement.  What you do is basically the steps from Exercise 05, but you're doing it *inside* the shapes you did in your first statement.  *You will need at least 5 values of pastel to complete this exercise.*

Here's you do this, but remember this is just a set of notes and you should watch the video:

1. Look carefully inside the first shape you want to refine.  Let's say it's the background, which actually is pure black but there is a slightly less black side of the floor that faces the light.
2. You then subdivide this shape into 2 or 3 shapes inside it, using the two closest values to the original.  In the background you probably used the dark value, so take the dark and light-dark, then use those to paint in 2 or 3 more shapes.
3. As you paint in the shape, be sure to correct it as well.  This may require not painting all of it so you can paint what's next to it, or painting over some of a shape next to it.  Pastel is nice because it is opaque so you can just erase by painting more.
4. You then move on to the next shape you see two or three shapes inside.  Let's say it's the dark gray left side.
5. You are now working on the shapes inside this one, but also connecting it to the dark background.  Again, use two sticks to get the original value and the next closes value using blending or alternating sticks.  As I said, watch the video because it's infinitely easier to see me do this.
6. Finally, as you move from shape to shape, putting shapes inside and connecting it to other shapes, you refine the whole drawing until it looks closer to the photo.

Remember that as you do this you can correct any mistakes you made in the shape, angles, proportions, or even values you used.  You should also avoid blending as that's reserved for the third statement.

Exercise Assignment

One more time with this cube:

Remember to follow the second statement process and work on correcting the first statement and also dividing it into smaller shapes with more values.
