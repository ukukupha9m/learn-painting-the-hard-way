Exercise 07: The Second Statement
=================================

One more time with this cube:

Your pastel painting from Exercise 06 should be melted and dry.  You actually don't *have* to melt your pastels and can just do this exercise anyway.  When you only do two layers of pastels you have enough texture to make the pastel stick.  It's when you get to the 3rd and 4th layer of pastels where you run into trouble.  As you layer on more pastel you can't stick more and you knock off other layers.  The alcohol causes that first layer of pastel to not count against you and also act as a rough sandpaper for later layers.

Now you can do your second statement of the pastel painting.  In this step you are using your pastel to refine and correct your previous statement.  What you do is basically the steps from Exercise 05, but you're doing it *inside* the shapes you did in your first statement.

Here's you do this, but remember this is just a set of notes and you should watch the video:

1. Look carefully inside the first shape you want to refine.  Let's say it's the background, which actually is pure black but there is a slightly less black side of the floor that faces the light.
2. Taking your first stick, and possibly the next darkest stick, you paint down the original value and the new value.  In this case you can use the black stick and one more stick that is close to black.
3. You then *change the edges with your gloved finger using blending*.  You can also use the sticks and changes in pressure to blend, but try your finger.  Remember to wear gloves.  You'll see better in the video, but the darkest black is so subtle that you need to not have a hard edge between them.
4. You then move on to the next shape you see two or three shapes inside.  Let's say it's the dark gray left side.
5. You are now working on the shapes inside this one, but also connecting it to the dark background.  Again, use two sticks to get the original value and the next closes value using blending or alternating sticks.  As I said, watch the video because it's infinitely easier to see me do this.
6. Finally, as you move from shape to shape, putting shapes inside and connecting it to other shapes, you refine the whole drawing until it looks closer to the photo.

Remember that as you do this you can correct any mistakes you made in the shape, angles, proportions, or even values you used.

Exercise Assignment
-------------------

You are done with this drawing, and it's possibly your first drawing in pastels.  Now I want you to take a photo of it and throw it in the garbage.  Just crumple it up and toss it.

Why?  Because it is just a study.  They should not be perfect.  They should be something you can throw away and try again.  If you treat these studies like they are precious you'll get hung up on making them perfect and that will prevent you from learning the important lesson at this point:  getting started.  Getting started is difficult, and one thing that gets in the way of the start is feeling like it should be perfect.

In the start, everything is flawed.  It takes time and multiple statements to get close to accurate, and even then your paintings will be a little off because you made them and you're human.  That's what makes them fun and interesting.

So toss that study out and start another one. Then throw that one away too.  Trust me, you'll do a lot of these little studies.
