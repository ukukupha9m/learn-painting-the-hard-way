Exercise 12: Multiple Simple Shapes
===================================

I am now going to give you photos of more shapes for you to attempt paintings.  You don't have to do *all* of these, but you should attempt 1 of each shape possible. Some might be ones you've already done, but you should attempt the full proces on those again.  In the video for this exercise I attempt small faster paintings of each shape to demonstrate how to approach them.

Cylinders
