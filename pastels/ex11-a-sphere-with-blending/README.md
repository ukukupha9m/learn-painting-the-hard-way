Exercise 11: A Sphere With Blending
===================================

I am now going to give you three different spheres to attempt. Each sphere is gray, but placed on a different background.  First you have the white background:

Then you have it on a black background:

Finally, the most complicated sphere is a gray sphere on a gray background:

You will be doing 3 paintings using each of these spheres *and* you will be trying to use blending.  It seems easy to paint a sphere but you'll find this is a surprising challenge.  Take your time with it and do your best.

Preliminary Studies
-------------------

You are slowly building a process for doing a painting of more complicated subjects.  The process you're learning will work on every thing you want to paint, but is mostly for doing "painterly" style paintings.  That means, they obviously look like a painting rather than look like a photo.  The process you already have is this:

1. Do a basic quick first statement "guess" using 3 values.  You can do this using any drawing style I showed you.
2. Melt the pastels so you can work on the first statement again.
3. Do a second statement, correcting what you see is different from the photo, and still using 3 values.
4. Do a 3rd statement using 5 values and blending edges or values as needed.

You will now add a #0 (because I'm a programmer so it's kind of funny) which is to do a preliminary sketch or study before you start.  A first study helps you get warmed up and find problems you're likely to encounter.  You might also find that the quick preliminary studies turn out better than your more involved paintings.

To do a study take a small piece of pastel paper (or just mark off a small corner of it), and work out a 3 value sketch of it.  Only spend 10-20 minutes on it, and if you don't get close, then do another one.  Use the study to work out what values will work, what shapes should go where, and give yourself a little plan.  Then keep your study with you when you start the full painting.

Exercise Assignment
-------------------

You are to do three preliminary studies and then 3 paintings in 5 values with blending.  I recommend doing the spheres in order (gray on white, gray on black, white on white) but if you feel that you could do them in a different order then go for it.  Also remember that these are all just studies so if you don't do well on one then just try again.  Take breaks.  Who cares if you don't nail on the first, second, or tenth try?  It's a stupid monochrome painting of a sphere.

Sphere Tricks
-------------

I studied with an artist who was obsessed with spheres.  She made me draw probably 20 spheres.  Over and over and over again.  I did small ones, and big ones, and medium ones, all with a tiny little pencil.  Scratch, scratch, scratch, for hours at a time.  I'm still not sure why she made me do those spheres since, well, she didn't make anyone else grind out spheres for months on end, but I did them and never blended like she demanded.  Just used that tiny little pencil.

I eventually figured out that this teacher demanded that none of her students blend drawings, yet she blended nearly everything she did.  She just used the pencil to blend very inefficiently, or blended with her brush when she painted.  Once I realized this I sat down with some pastels and cranked out much better spheres in 1/100th the time by simply blending the edges and moving on with my life.  I realized that using pastels I could study a subject much faster and easier.  This speed gave me a faster feedback loop and improved my ability to study the subject.  Also, doing a sphere with a pastel is easy.

The trick to making a sphere is to just blend.  It's so much easier and every single artist who claims they don't blend actually does.  Not only that, but incredibly famous painters going back hundreds of years used blending.  I may tell you to avoid doing something for study, but when it comes down to your own painting do whatever works.  Every other painter "cheats", so you can too.
