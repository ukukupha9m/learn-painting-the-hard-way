Exercise 00: Gearing Up
=======================

In this course I'm going to use two things to teach you the basics of painting:

* A digital painting program for the lectures about concepts.
* Pastels to show you how it's done for real using physical media.

My skills in digital painting are not good enough to say this course will teach you how to paint digitally.  It's simply easier to do a lecture and then flip to a drawing program to show you what I mean.

You could do this course with digital, but the real fun is in using pastel.  There's something human and soothing about using a stick of dirt to make an image of something you see.  Maybe it's just because I find computers frustrating that I get a nice break when I paint with pastels.  Either way, there will also be a demo using pastels for you to follow.

What Is Pastel?
===============

Pastels are sticks of fancy looking dirt similar to a chalk you may use on a sidewalk.  You make a pastel with four things:

1. A pigment.  This is the fancy dirt.  Pigment is what gives a pastel its color.  You might have a red pigment, blue, or even a gray or black pigment.  Pigment is in your clothes, car paint, and most physical thing that has color.  You will also use two or more pigments to change the color.  If you want a light stick you mix in white pigment.  If you want a dark stick you might mix in a black or other dark color.
2. A binder.  There's a lot of recipes for making pastels, but usually the binder is a bit of a glue and a dust.
3. The glue, dust, and pigment are mixed together into a paste and then formed into a stick with your hands.  Some companies use a mold or cast, but the principle is the same.  You give it shape, and then...
4. You cook it or let it dry somehow.  This usually requires heat, so some people put it in the sun, and others use an oven.  This makes it like a clay pot and you can get different hardness depending on the amount of heat.

When you're done, you get a fancy chalk that lets you put the pigment onto a piece of paper to make your painting.  That leads me to the next thing you need which is a paper for pastels.  You can use a normal piece of paper but it doesn't work as well as a special piece of paper for pastels.  These pieces of paper will have bumps in them that capture the pastels as you touch them, and some papers will have sand on them exactly like a piece of sandpaper for woodworking.  When you touch the pastel to the paper, the pastel breaks off and leaves behind the pigment and binder and that's painting.

You can't just hold the piece of paper in your hand though as the paper will flop around and be too soft.  What you need is a board that you tape the piece of paper to so that it's held stiff and solid.  That means you need a board, and some tape too.

Finally, you can take your pastels and melt them with rubbing alcohol or water to get interesting effects and to help you in the painting process.  This isn't necessary but it makes things a lot easier.

That means, you need the following things to get started with this course:

1. A box of gray pastels.  I recommend the [Mungyo Gallery Semi-hard Gray set of 12](http://www.jerrysartarama.com/mungyo-gallery-semi-hard-pastel-sets) pastels.  You can get them from almost anywhere, and they're very inexpensive.  A box of 12 will cost you about $11USD.  If you can't find those, then just get 4 sticks of grays that go from light to dark, then get a white and a totally black stick.  It can be any brand, but softer is probably better than harder.
2. A pad of pastel paper, size 9" by 12" or close to that.  If you have a good sanded paper you can actually use really terrible pastels and do great work.  So, if you can afford it get the UART or Sennelier paper.  If you can't then just get the Mi-Teintes or the Borden and Reiley.  I'll be using all of these in the course so you can see how they work. I recommend any of these:

   * [Canson Mi-Teintes Gray Tones](http://www.jerrysartarama.com/canson-mi-teintes-pads)
   * [UART Sanded Paper](http://www.jerrysartarama.com/uart-pastel-paper)
   * [Pastelmat](http://www.jerrysartarama.com/pastelmat)
   * [Sennelier La Carte Pastel Pads](http://www.jerrysartarama.com/sennelier-la-carte-pastel-paper-pads)
   * [Borden and Riley Pastel Paper](http://www.bordenandriley.com/View/410-CharcoalPastel-Paper-Portrait-Grey-Cloth-Bound-Pads)

3. A board for the paper. You can use a big piece of stiff cardboard or any wood board you have lying around.  It just has to be rigid enough to keep the paper stiff.  If you want a nicer board then you can use a drawing board or a piece of gatorboard.  I also like a simple painting panel too.  Here's a decent list if you want to buy something:

   * [Gatorfoam Board](https://www.dickblick.com/products/gatorfoam-board/)
   * [Ampersand Panel](http://www.jerrysartarama.com/ampersand-value-panels-smooth-finish)
   * Really anything will work.  Don't spend a ton of money on this, and get a board that's bigger than your paper.  So if you have a 9x12 paper you should get an 11x14 board or bigger.

4. A roll of tape.  Just a roll of regular masking tape from a office supply store will work.
5. A bottle of 95% or 99% rubbing alcohol.  The bottle should say "isopropyl alcohol" and you should get the highest you can.  Usually you can find 95% at any pharmacy or super market.  99% seems to be harder to get, but I purchased some online.
6. A really terrible soft 1/2" brush.  You can usually get one used for painting from a hardware store or any art store.  Synthetic watercolor brushes work well, but any terrible brush you don't care about will work.

That should be it, and depending on where you get this it should be around $20-40 in cost.  If you team up with a friend you can cut that in half since the box of pastels I recommend has two stick for each color.

Video Demonstration

The video that goes with this exercise simply shows you what these materials are, what each one looks like, how I buy them online, and some simple demos of how they work.
