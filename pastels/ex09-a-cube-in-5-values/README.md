Exercise 09: A Cube in 5 Values
===============================

Continuing with the same cube:

Your simple 3 value cube most likely looks like "a cube", but it might not look exactly like this cube.  This cube is complicated because it has many subtle shifts in values inside each shape.  You can't quite capture this effect with only 3 values, so in this exercise you'll do a 3rd statement using 5 values. 

You can do quite a lot with only 3 values, but to make a realistic looking painting you'll need anywhere from 5 to 7 values and probably blending.  I'll say again that this obsession with "accuracy" is really only useful when you're learning to paint.  You improve your visual comprehension and sensitivity by trying to be very accurate.  Then when you start to do your own art this training helps you paint how you want but still maintain control and match the painting to your idea.

It's best to think of this as a game of getting as close as you can before you give up in frustration.  Keep trying, then slowly you'll get better at both accuracy and concentration.  You should also realize that it's completely fine for a painting to be "close" and paintings that are on the edge of realistic re usually better than ones that look exactly like a photo.

Exercise Assignment
-------------------

You are free to use multiple sticks but *do not blend*.   It's hard to not blend pastels because they look so great when you do, but resist the temptation.  You may even see me do it a few times even though I'm trying not to blend.

You should start first by dividing each shape into "lighter" and "darker" valued sub-shapes, and then paint it as best you can without blending.  As usual, watch the video to see how I do it since watching others paint is an easier way to learn.

Are You Bored?
--------------

Did that cube bore you to death?  That's actually a sign that you've learned the topic well, but how do you really know?  If you were bored with the cube then find an object in your house that's like a cube and see if you can do a painting of it.  Just give it a shot and see what you get.  If it doesn't come out well then you know you have more work to do.  If it does comes out well then you probably still have work to do.
