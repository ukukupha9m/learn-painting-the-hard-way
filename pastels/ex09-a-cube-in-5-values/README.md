Exercise 09: A Cube in 5 Values
===============================

You now have the full painting process you'll use for the rest of the book:

1. Do a painterly drawing using 3 values that's your first statement, getting fairly close to accurate, but don't worry if it's not.
2. Melt the pastels with alcohol to obliterate some of the drawing that you know you have to correct anyway, adjust edges, and fix the pastel to the paper.
3. Do your second statement using 5 values with no blending.  You correct mistakes and divide big shapes into 2-3 sub-shapes.
4. Do your third statement using 5 values and blending to finish the painting, dividing shapes into as small sub-shapes as possible.
5. Throw it in the garbage unless you really truly deeply love it.

You will now do the complete process again using this new cube:

Are You Bored?
--------------

Did that cube bore you to death?  That's actually a sign that you've learned the topic well, but how do you really know?  If you were bored with the cube then find an object in your house that's like a cube and see if you can do a painting of it.  Just give it a shot and see what you get.  If it doesn't come out well then you know you have more work to do.  If it does comes out well then you probably still have work to do.
