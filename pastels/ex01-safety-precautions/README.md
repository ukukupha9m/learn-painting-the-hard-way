Exercise 01: Safety Precautions
===============================

I promise we'll get to painting in a few exercises, but first we have to cover a few more technical things.  In this exercise we'll talk about pastel safety.

I was at a conference watching a very accomplished pastel painter.  He was on stage, and he was thrashing around on his painting.  It was a great painting, but he was not wearing gloves, getting all the colors on everything, and putting his hands in his mouth in rabid excitement.  He was snorting and eating the pastel dust like it was a powdered donut.  When someone asked him why he didn't wear gloves he said, "That's nonsense.  I've been doing this for 30 years and I'm fine.  No health problems at all."

This artist needed to learn the concept of survivor bias.  Survivor bias is where you think a poison is not deadly because you only see the survivors of the poison.  You walk around a field and see 100 mice and say, "See? This pesticide is totally safe."  Problem is, you don't see the 2000 mice who died last month from the pesticide.

The fallacy this artist is making is assuming that pastels are totally safe because him and 4 of his friends have survived for 30 years breathing and bathing in poison dust.  What he doesn't see is the thousands and thousands of artists who quit because their skin, lungs, or eyes can't handle the constant exposure.  Or, the thousands who die from cancer from exposure to toxins.

Pastels are very safe, but you never know what *your* body can handle.  You might be very sensitive to the dust, or you might have an allergy to it.  Allergies are weird because you could use pastels for years then one day your body says, "Enough! Have some rashes jerk!"  Your best bet is to simply take a few precautions and limit your exposure.

Your goal with pastel safety is to simply avoid too much exposure.  A little is not that bad, but constantly exposing your body to an irritating dust full of pigments can cause you significant problems.  You also don't know what we might find in the future.  What if we find out that Hansa Yellow pigments are actually incredibly toxic?

With pastels, all you need to do to reduce your exposure is the following:

1. Wear nitrile gloves while you paint.  Many artists are worried that gloves will limit their expression, but I like to point out that doctors wear gloves and perform surgery on people's eyes and brains.  I'm sure if a brain surgeon can wear gloves while they delicately cut a tumor around a vein in someone's head, then you can wear gloves while you scratch some chalks onto paper.
2. Never blow on your pastel painting to remove excess pastel.  Try this experiment:  Blow really hard on in the air like you're blowing away a fly.  What happened right after you exhaled?  You inhaled right?  What happens when you blow on your pastel painting is you fling dust into the air and then *immediately* breath it in with a big gulp.  If you have excess pastel on your board, just tap the back of it and it will fall off and not fly in the air.
3. If you are sensitive to dust, just wear a simple dust mask like people wear sometimes when they're sick or around sick people.  You don't need an intense gas mask, but like Darth Vader, but a little mask will help a lot.
4. Either wipe your gloves off periodically with a wet paper towel or simply change them whenever you take a break.  This will keep it off your clothes and also help you keep your colors clean.
5. Make sure you wash your hands before you eat, and never eat while you're painting pastel.  If you drink use a covered cup like a thermos or just don't drink while you paint.  I also wash my face off as sometimes the dust gets on it, but I'm a little more serious about keeping the dust off.

That's all you need to do and you should be fine painting in pastels.  However, if you know you have a severe respiratory problem then I recommend you *not* use pastels at all.  You should use oil paints or just go all digital painting.  I'll have an oil painting course just like this one very soon.

Finally, if any artist claims that you aren't a real artist until you are bathing in poisons then they are not a good teacher.  No profession or hobby is so awesome you have to kill yourself to do it.  There are also plenty of incredibly accomplished artists who wear lab coats and work very cleanly and slowly, so whoever is telling you this is most likely a poseur idiot who is just being a macho jerk.
