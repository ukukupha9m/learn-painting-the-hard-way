Introduction
============

Learning to paint isn't difficult, but for many people a traditional class is not possible.  Most art education costs money or assumes that a student can attend a class for extended periods of time.  For many people this simply is not possible.  Some people don't have the money.  Other people can't find the time to leave their house and spend 8 hours for a week studying art.  Others don't have the physical mobility to go to an art school and sit at an easel to paint.

This course is designed so that nearly anyone can at least learn the basics of painting and begin making art for their own enjoyment.  I've made every effort to keep the course simple, low cost, and accessible to as many people as I possibly can.  In this course I don't expect you to buy expensive materials, plaster casts, easels, alter your house, go outside, or be very physically capable.  As long as you can barely push a stick onto a piece of paper and look at a photo you'll be able to do the course.

Some of the things I plan on anticipating are:

Visual Abilities
================

You don't need to have perfect vision to learn to paint.  You obviously can't be completely blind, but if you are I suggest you try sculpture instead of painting.  But, this course should work even if you are totally color blind, partially blind, or have other limitations.  The first half of the book is entirely in black and white, and you use photos as a reference.  That will allow most anyone to study painting.

Physical Mobility
=================

In many classes students are expected to haul giant loads of paint, canvas, easels, and other equipment to rooms or fields and try to paint.  They're also expected to sit for hours staring at plaster statues in cabinets trying to paint perfect copies of what they see.  This simply isn't possible for many people with physical limitations.  In this course I only use photos for you to reference, and you can use them from a computer or even a terrible black and white printout from a laser printer.

The materials I use are also lightweight and easy to use.  I chose pastels because they are very light, non toxic, easy to use, and very inexpensive.  In the beginning you only use a few gray sticks of pastel and some simple paper combined with maybe a board for the paper.  Doing the monochrome studies in pastels is the easiest and cheapest way for people to begin.

Then the second half of the course switches to oil paints to explore color.  I chose oil paint for the color lessions because it is the easiest and cheapest way to learn to exactly render color you see.  Pastels would be easier to *use*, but purchasing a full color palette would cost $400 USD or more.  With oils you can spend about $50 USD and have enough oil paint to last you a year or more.

Economic Constraints
====================

Not everyone can spend $300 or more on painting equipment, but many classes will list out paints and supplies that cost that much or more.  If you add easels, canvases, palettes, brushes, knives, and all the gear you can spend $1000 in your first month of learning to paint.  In this course I use pastels and oils because you can get all the materials you need to start for about $20.  Even if you go nuts and get the better materials you still will only spend around $100 USD, and could go even lower if you follow my guides.  This will then last you a few months or more depending on how often you paint.

Classes are another cost when trying to learn to paint. Most art classes can cost $400 for just 4 days of a workshop, which also requires taking time off from work that adds another cost.  Art universities can cost $180,000 a year to attend.  For many people this is a large barrier to entry so I've made this course free.

Health Constraints
==================

A lot of people simply can't use oil paints because of health concerns. In this course I use the safest oil paints I can find which are water soluble and feature no dangerous pigments.  Most painting courses require you to use solvents and even advocate that you slather the paint all over your arms or you aren't a "real artist".  In this course I'll advocate for safety and help you avoid unnecessary exposure.

Pastels are also safe to use, but still not totally safe. Nothing is totally safe, but pastels have very few risks.  In the beginning there are not color pigments so the only risk is breathing the dust or irritating your skin.  I'll teach you how to avoid both, but if you have respiratory problems then I recommend waiting until I have the oil painting version of the course.

Finally, quite a few of the demos I do in the videos for the course will use digital painting.  If you really cannot handle any exposure to dust or solvents then you can simply do the whole course in digital and have no problems.  I will point you at some free digital painting tools, but the one I chose to use will cost about $50.

Time Constraints
================

I designed this course to be self directed because I find most art courses require way too much of student's time.  In a traditional course you'll go to a class and spend 6-8 hours painting while the teacher walks around and helps some.  You may get lucky and spend that 6-8 hours watching a demo.  You do this for 4-5 days in a workshop, or a whole semester, and then have to study on your own anyway.  Many people simply do not have the ability to take a week off from work, or to attend an art class full time.

In this course, you can watch my lectures and demos when you want.  You can then set aside whatever time you have to attempt the exercise.  You can take a week for each exercise, a day, a month, whatever works for you.  You can study this course for a year, six months, it doesn't matter.  You won't get fired, bad grades, or ridiculed for taking your time.

Cognitive Differences
=====================

Art is a great way to express who are as a person.  You can spend hours just letting your personality come through on a piece of paper and nobody needs to even see what you did.  The art world is also full of people who are incredibly strange and celebrated for it, but I find the most important thing about art is that art doesn't care who you are.  The pigment doesn't care if you are cognitively different from everyone else.  The pigment simply reflects you and the effort you put into it.

I have found though that most art teachers (actually, most people) are incredibly intolerant of anyone different from them.  Artists make a big show of respecting people's differences and being progressive, but they will frequently ostracize and ignore students they just don't like.  I find this incredibly wrong in a paid course simply because my payment to that teacher is all that's needed to earn their respect and fairness.  That's how a professional works, but many art teachers are incredibly unprofessional and in addition to taking my money they also demand worship, devotion, and only want to teach people just like them.

What I like about online courses is that I don't have to like you to teach you the same as everyone else.  You could be someone that I actually really hate, but since I wrote this course for people I like by extension I'll treat you the same way.  I can't decide that I don't like your politics, behavior, schizophrenia, or skin color and then suddenly stop teaching you.  You get the course I wrote out of love and caring, and once I release it I can't really change it.


Emotional Abilities
===================

Not everyone deals with stress and emotions the same, but many artists think that it's alright to push their view of artistic expression on others.  You're maybe told that you're not a real artist until you emotionally connect to your subject, or expose some deep painful tragedy in your art.  This ridicule for not carving your soul out in your art is wrong because it doesn't take into account the problems that others face when dealing with their feelings.

In this course I will never tell you that you're not a real artist if you just like painting flowers and have zero emotion for it.  You do not have to dredge up past traumas and paint like it's therapy unless you want to.  I feel that painting's real benefit is in giving you a few hours of forgetting, not by giving you a few hours of unguided therapy.

But the most important reason I'm not going to push any kind of emotional expression as a goal is that I simply don't know you.  You have your own reasons for wanting to paint, and you don't have to justify them to anyone.  Painting doesn't have to be a deep psychological pretentious activity.  It can just be a fun thing you do to take your mind off the day.  So you paint for whatever reasons you want to paint, or no reasons at all.
