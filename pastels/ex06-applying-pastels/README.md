Exercise 06: Applying Pastels
=============================

You hopefully stopped after your first statement of the cube from exercise 5.  You need to have only 4 basic shapes done and it doesn't matter if they're a little wrong.  You'll actually learn how to melt the pastel into your paper so that you can do your next statement on the top without difficulty.

1. What you need to do is take the isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol) you bought and put a *tiny* amount into a small cup.  You don't need much.
2. Now take your brush and dip it in the alcohol and then brush the alcohol gently onto the *darkest* part of the painting, trying not to drip too much.  That would be the black background first.
3. Rinse the brush in some water to clear the black pastel out and then dry it on a paper towel.
4. Now get some more alcohol on the brush and paint it into the next darkest shape, rinse the brush, dry it.
5. Repeat this until you get through all the shapes, going from dark to light.  Your white shape might deteriorate quite a bit but that's fine, just try your best to keep it clean.

It's preferable if you soften the edges of these shapes as you melt the pastels.  This will make it easier to put the next layer of pastel on top and fix any errors in your shapes.  You can also use this melting process to fix shapes.  You'll see that pastel is very opaque (meaning it covers real well and doesn't let anything under it show through), so you can paint the pastel over other pastel.  That's *usually* you can.  Sometimes it won't work if it's light pastel over dark pastel.

You should wait for about 10-20 minutes to let your painting totally dry after doing this.  It will look very soft and "wispy" if you do it, but that's what you want.  You'll then be going back over it with a better attempt and smaller shapes to make it more realistic.

Exercise Assignment
-------------------

As before you should watch me do this on the video just to be sure you know what I'm talking about.  You may also want to try water to see how it compares to alcohol.  You may find that water works, but it warps the paper and the pastel doesn't really melt too well.
