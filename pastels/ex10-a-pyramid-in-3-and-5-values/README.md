Exercise 10: A Pyramid in 3 and 5 Values
========================================

Isn't that cube so exciting?!  Seriously, it's boring, but remember the reasons we're doing this.  You need to practice seeing 3D scenes you see onto a 2D surface as shapes and values with pastels.  If you tried to learn this on a complicated subject you would be overloaded with details and be frustrated and confused.  Using stupid little cubes removes a lot of the pressure.

Another thing to remember is that simple subjects many times are also very beautiful.  Learning to find beauty in things other people consider boring or ugly is part of learning to paint.

Exercise Assignment
-------------------

Your subject this time is a simple pyramid:

You're building a process for painting what you see and in this painting you're simply practicing the following process:

1. Do a basic quick first statement "guess" using 3 values.  You can do this using any drawing style I showed you.
2. Melt the pastels so you can work on the first statement again.
3. Do a second statement, correcting what you see is different from the photo, and still using 3 values.
4. Do a 3rd statement using 5 values.

In the next exercise you'll learn to blend the pastels to make the edges softer, but you should be able to see how *not* blending the edges still works.  Many times in a painterly style you'll leave the bits of color you place alone so that they look striking or interesting.  You also many times don't need to blend if you have enough values to work with while you're painting.  In oil painting and watercolor you have a nearly infinite gradation of values from light to dark.  In pastels you have a very fixed set of values in each of the 5 sticks, so blending is necessary to get soft edges.  But, this exercise should show you that you don't need to (and probably shouldn't) blend all the time.
