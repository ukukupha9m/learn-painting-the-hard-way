Dedication
----------

This course is dedicated to Ana.  I took my first drawing class with her, and because of her encouragement I stuck with it.  Without her I would have never discovered painting and the happiness it gives me every day.

I also dedicate this course to all the weird little kids who wanted to make art but were told that nerds, dorks, and logical people can't be creative.  I'm a programmer who writes courses teaching other people how to code and thinks Bob Ross is a genius.  It really does not get more nerd, dork, and logical than me.  So if I can paint, then you can too.

Color Painting with Oils
------------------------

You now move into color using oil paints.  Pastels are fantastic to work with, and I'll briefly discuss how you can continue using them if you want.  However, doing the exercises in pastels requires buying a *huge* number of pastels and can cost almost $400 to $1700 depending on the brand of pastel you choose.  You'd also have to buy a large paint easel which is another $300 - $500.  Oil paints allow you to study color, mix exact colors you see, look great, and cost far less than a full set of pastels.  You can probably do all of these exercises with 4 big tubes of paint, 2 brushe, 1 knife, and cheap panels or paper.  Total cost is about $40 or maybe $80 at the most and will last you probably a year if you paint every day.  Oil paints also have the unique property that they can be matched exactly to what you see which helps you learn to see color better.

Color Still Life Studies
------------------------

You then start at the beginning and do your original still life studies but using color instead of monochrome.  You will learn to select your set of colors before you start, get a basic drawing down in an "under painting", and then render the color as best you can.

Color Texture Studies
---------------------

You then move on to studying textures again, but with color this becomes much easier.  In fact, your goal in this section is to try not to do too much in your attempt to create the effect of each texture.  With pastels you could slave over each subject and render out every tiny hair on a teddy bear, but that's not the point.  The point is to do more with less.  Don't assume that your viewer is an idiot and leave something for them to ponder.

Color Advanced Studies
----------------------

You now get into the fun final projects that are entire genres of painting all on their own.  I will go through these final projects, and also provide you with lists of other books that will help you learn more about them if you want to dive deep into them.  I will also include many landscapes by myself and other artists which you can copy.  Copying other artists is a very solid way to learn how to paint and get better.

The End?
--------

In the end I'll lay out ideas for more pastel subjects, talk to you about oils and watercolor, and then give you some final words of advice on making art for your own enjoyment.
