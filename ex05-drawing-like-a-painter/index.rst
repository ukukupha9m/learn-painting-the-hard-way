Exercise 05: Drawing Like a Painter
===================================

You have seen short quick little demonstrations of the major styles of drawing, so now let's do your first attempt at the painterly style you'll use in this book.  We'll use our friend the cube:

If you remember from Exercise 04 the painterly style is this:

1. You take the values found in your subject.  In this book that would be 4 sticks of pastel, one for each level of gray, black, and white in the photo.
2. You start with the most obvious and simple shape you see.  That is *probably* the dark gray shape of the left side of the box.
3. You paint one simple big version of this shape, trying to get its size, proportion, and shape correct.
4. You then paint the next obvious shape connected to this one using the next value, and continue putting down big connected shapes until you have the whole paper covered.  That could be the next light gray shape on the left side of the cube, followed by the top of the cube, and then the black background.
5. This is considered your "first statement", so it can and will have errors.  You'll then repeat this process *inside* each shape to refine it further with smaller shapes until you are satisfied or bored.

In this exercise you will only go as far as step 4 to learn how to get started.

Exercise Assignment
-------------------

Watch the video I have for this exercise, and then attempt your first painting of this cube.  Remember that you are only doing a first statement with really simple big shapes and only using 4 sticks of pastel:  white, black, light gray, dark gray.  You can keep the photo on your computer, put it on a tablet, or even print out a simple monochrome printout with a terrible.  Whatever works to give you something to use as a reference, but if you can use a computer screen then that's best.
