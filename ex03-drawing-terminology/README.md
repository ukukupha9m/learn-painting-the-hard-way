Exercise 03: Drawing Terminology
================================

Let's look at this image of a cube again and talk about drawing:

There is a video that goes with this exercise. After you read what I have to say you should watch the video.  It is generally easier to understand painting ideas from a video.

Drawing
-------

In this exercise I'm going to use the word "drawing" to talk about these concepts, but they also apply to painting.  The word drawing can mean "I used a pencil to draw my dog on paper", but it can also mean "the part of painting that makes a painting look real."  With that in mind, we can say that "drawing" is the monochrome part of painting, but that's a simple definition to make it easier to understand what's going on.  Different poeple will have different ideas about what a "drawing" is, but I like just saying, "it's the monochrome parts of painting."

Shape
-----

When you look at this cube you at first see it as a real three dimensional object.  It literally has three sides facing you: a top, left, and right side.  Now, stare at this photo long enough and you stop seeing these parts of the cube as an object and you'll start to see each side as a separate shape.  The top will be a white shape. The right a light gray shape. The left a dark gray shape.  In drawing, when you get the shapes to match what you see then your drawing will start to look like what you see.  But, you need a few more things to make it work.

As you paint the word "shape" will become more and more complex.  When I look at this same photo I see a great many shapes all merging together to make this image.  You'll eventually start to see them too, but it takes time to build your sensitivity to them.

Value
-----

When you look at this cube you probably see a large black surface with a cube on it.  The cube has three sides visible, and each side is a different "shade" of gray.  The top is white, the side on the right is light gray, and the side on the left is dark gray.  With just this information--no color at all--you can make out that this cube has three sides and you can tell where the light probably is relative to the cube.  In this photo, it is up and to the right of the cube pointing down at it.

In drawing a "value" is the amount of dark or light in a shape.  I mentioned that if you get the shapes right then your drawing will start to look like what you see, but not quite.  You also need to match the value (dark or light level) of the shape so that it looks light is hitting parts of the object or not.  The values show your eye where the light is, and the dark or light tells your brain how the light shows the form of the object.  If you get the shapes right, and get the values right, then your drawing will look like it is 3D even though it's on a flat piece of paper or canvas.

Proportion
----------

I keep using this word "right", but it's not a great word.  You can make quite a lot of art and never be "right" about anything.  How do you make your shapes and values "right" or "correct" if you want to do that?  You look at the "proportion" of one shape to another in the scene.  Another word for "proportion" might be "relative", as in "how does this shape relate to the other shape"?  Now, if your shapes are correct that basically means that each shape is proportionally matching the other shapes near it.

For example, if you took the top shape and made it too small then the other two sides would have to bend in to match it.  That would make the top of the cube out of proportion with the rest of the cube.

Negative Shape
--------------

A "negative" shape is simply all the shapes around another one.  Another way to see the "negative shape" is to look behind a shape.  If you look at the background behind the cube you see that big black shape.  If you were to ignore the cube and only draw that big black shape you might actually get the proportions of the cube right better than trying to draw the cube.

This is a trick you can use to get a shape correct.  If you can't figure it out, try comparing it to the negative shape around it, or try drawing everything *but* that shape.


Edge
----

Take a very close look at the top of this cube.  Now, there's a corner of this top shape that is closest to you, and one that is in the far back.  If you look carefully at the corner closest to you it should look very focused and crisp.  If you look carefully at the corner farthest from you it should look blurry and out of focus.  This is because I used a camera and focused right on that corner in the front, which made the back out of focus.

That blurry out of focus corner in the back looks out of focus because of how it "connects" to the other two shapes and the background.  Where two or more shapes connect is called an "edge", and the sharpness or softness of an edge determines it's focus *or* its connection to another shape.  For example, inside each of the three sides of the cube there are actually subtle shapes that are connected with very soft edges.  You might not be able to see them yet, but you'll learn how as you practice.

Ground
------

This is the name used for the surface you are painting or drawing on.  This can be a piece of paper, canvas, glass, metal, or any flat surface.  It can also be the word used for the background of an object in a picture.  In this photo the cube is surrounded by black, and that black is the ground for the cube.

Correct
-------

Like many things in art "correct" is relative.  I've seen top accomplished portrait artists paint a painting of a person and the end result looks like *a* person but not *the* person they were painting.  Many times the correctness of a painting only depends on the final finished painting and not on a comparison with the actual subject.  As long as everyone thinks you painting an apple then you painted an apple.  Doesn't matter if you didn't really paint exactly the apple you're looking at.

There's also a strange phenomenon in drawing where you work on a drawing for hours and think, "Yes! I did it! This is perfect!"  Then your friend walks by and points at some random part and says, "What about that?"  Suddenly you see all the obvious errors in your drawing and it's definitely not perfect.  I have no idea why this happens, but you'll learn how to use tricks to help you see your own errors as you work while also just accepting your mistakes as part of your art style.


Exercise Assignment
-------------------

Your assignment is to study this photo and look for all of these terms.  You should also watch the video for this exercise to see a *visual* demonstration of each term.  Finally, you should make little flash cards with these words and try to remember what they mean.  The good news is this is probably all the terms you need for the first half of the book.
