Exercise 08: A Cube in 3 Values
===============================

Wasn't that cube so exciting?  You may be wondering why we're doing such simple subjects as boxes and balls.  The goal of this course is to remove as much distraction from the core of each little lesson.  In the last 7 exercises the goal was to teach you how to apply pastel to paper.  There is no color, complex scenes, difficult drawing, or anything but pastel on paper.  If you managed to get pastel on your paper and it sort of looked like that cube then you succeeded.

We will now work on a new cube:

Don't get scared now.  I know the last cube was easy because it was all black and then clear light grays for the cube.  *This* cube is a white cube on a white background, so it is more complex but not really.  Take the time to study this new cube and you might find:

1. The cube is nearly the same as the previous one in shape and size.
2. The shadow the cube casts is almost the same but now you can actually see it.
3. The shadow the cube casts is almost the same value as the dark side of the cube.  Seroiusly, compare the two and you'll see they're really close.
4. The floor and most of the background is nearly the same value as the side of the cube facing you on the left.
5. The top of the cube seems white, but as it moves farther from the light source is becomes darker.

If you study this closely you can actually do a first pass of the whole cube with three values total:

1. A white stick of pastel for the top.
2. A middle gray for the background, floor, *and* the front of the cube.
3. A dark gray for the back side of the cube and the shadow it casts.

Another way to do it might be this:

1. A white stick for the top.
2. A middle gray for the floor and background.
3. A dark gray for the front, back, and cast shadow.

How did I figure that out?  I used a couple tricks to spot values.

Spotting Values
---------------

Your brain plays a trick on you when it sees values in context.  If you see a dark shape inside a light background your brain will think that dark shape is much darker than it really is.  The same is true if you put a light shape inside a dark background.  How dark or light something is depends on what's around it, but to paint it you have to remove the context to see it clearly.

The first trick for seeing it clearly is to slightly close your eyes about half way.  This turns your eyes and eye lashes into a kind of filter that reduces the amount of light coming into your eyes and makes what you see less complex.  For seeing values this helps you see only 3-4 values instead of all the possible ones.  Try this now on the photo.

The second trick is to remove the context using a hole.  I take my fist and I make a small hole with it and look through at a spot inside a shape.  Since it's dark inside my fist the context changes for that spot, which isn't too helpful.  Where it comes in handy is when I use *two* fists.  I look through two fists with two holes pointed at different parts of the photo and now those two parts have the same context.  Right away I can easily compare them to see if they are the same or different.

You can also do this last trick with a middle gray card with a small hole in it.  Take a piece of your paper and use your middle pastel to make it gray.  Melt the pastel and then punch a small hole in the little piece of paper.  You can then compare all the other parts of this photo against your middle gray to see if it's darker or lighter.  Make two pieces of paper and you can compare two parts.

This might lead you to one more trick you can use:  Use your pastels to make a strip of squares with each value of pastel you have.  Then, punch holes in each square.  You can then use this strip to find the best value for a shape in your photo.  You just look through each square's hole pointed at the shape until you get close, and then that's your value for that shape.

Exercise Assignment
-------------------

In the video I show you how to narrow your focus down so you can more easily compare values.  Be sure you watch that demonstration, and also the demo for how I do this cube with only three value of pastel.

Then, I want you to approach this study a little differently than the last study.  Instead of simply copying the photo I want you to *copy my pastel*.  You can use the photo and my pastel to help you figure out how I did it and to make as close a copy of what I did as you can.  Think like you're trying to a forgery so that nobody can tell your version from mine.
