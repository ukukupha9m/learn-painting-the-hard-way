Who Are You
===========

I'm aiming this course at people who do not have any prior training in painting or a similar art form.  I think if you know how to draw, then this would be useful as a course in learning to paint.  In fact, if you can draw this course may be a little easier.  Otherwise, if you can already paint then this course may be too slow and basic for you.  I think in that case you should just try to copy paintings by other artists you admire.

When I say "people with no prior training" I also mean people with zero talent or ability.  Painting can be learned and doesn't require talent.  You can also enjoy it without talent.  In fact, I think people are way too obsessed with talent and that gets in the way of them simply being "pretty OK" at things they might enjoy.

You don't need to be a professional to enjoy doing something for fun, and that's my only goal with the course.  I'm not aiming to take someone with zero skill and turn them into a Rembrandt or Cezanne.  I'm simply aiming at taking someone with zero skill and teaching them enough to enjoy theirself in this incredibly fun but frustrating activity.

This goal doesn't mean that after my course you're stunted and can't continue to push your skills.  It should give you a good foundation in the basics which will let you continue to study other styles and methods.

You also may go through this course, or part of it, and just find it's incredibly boring and not your thing.  That is also totally alright.  You aren't expected to like everything, so as long as you gave it a shot and are making an educated decision then that's great.

Finally, I'm not writing this course to change the minds of people or push any kind of agenda or belief system on you.  All I'm doing is teaching you the basics of painting, and what you do with that is up to you.  I won't fill this book with psychobabel, religion, secret coded messages, politics, or anything but how to paint.

With all that said, if you feel this course is for you then continue on to `Exercise 00 <ex00-gearing-up/index.html>`_ .  If you think it's not for you then great.  I won't be offended if you decide not to use it.
