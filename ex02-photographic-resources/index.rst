Exercise 02: Photographic Resources
===================================

All of these exercises will be based on photos I've taken of the subjects.  I'm using photos because it is easier to teach how to paint from photos, and it's easier for you to get started with photos.  I used the very best camera I could afford so you can have the highest quality photos possible.  For each exercise I'll have multiple photos you can choose from and you can download sizes that work for your screen.

In classical training people learned to draw from lithographs or drawings created by their teachers.  These drawings are at such a high level of finish that they already look old monochrome photos.  This means that traditional art education basically used black and white photos to teach people to draw.  But, many of these drawings have errors in them that cause students problems.

Monochrome photos taken with a camera do not have errors in lighting, but aren't full of confusing color that makes them difficult to learn to paint.  By removing color you'll focus on the first difficulty in art--rendering three dimensions onto a flat surface--and by using photos you'll practice rendering real things without needing to buy those things.

Cameras do have some errors in shapes, but I've done the best I can to correct any errors I found in the photos before posting them.  Most of the changes are related to small lens distortions found in most photos.  I use the very best lenses I can and a camera that removes nearly all the distortion possible, so these photos are very close to what you'd see.

But, you aren't expected to *copy* these photos exactly.  You can try, but you're expected to *interpret* the photos.  That means, if you don't like something about the photo you can change it.  You'll see that the actual expected process is to use the photos *and my painting steps* to try to copy my painting of the subject, and *then* make your own version of the photo.  In many exercises I'll give you challenges to change how you paint from the photo to be creative and do it differently.

Finally, some people will tell you to not use photos to learn to paint.  You should know that almost every major accomplished artist learned to paint and/or draw from either photos or something that looked exactly like a photo.  Famous painters like Richard Schmid use photos and paint from computer monitors, and if they do it then you can do it.  Anyone trying to shame you into thinking that "real artists" don't use photos is lying.

I'll also say that rejecting photos as being too "technological" ignores the history of photography.  Photography was invented in `1816 by Nicéphore Niépce <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_photography#1816_to_1833:_Niépce's_earliest_fixed_images>`_ which makes the photo 202 years old, and potentially older if you consider earlier attempts in the 1700s.  Now, if someone is telling you that is too "new" to use, then they shoulds top using tin tubes to store their paint and nearly every pigment they use.  Tin tubes were invented in `1841 by John Rand <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Goffe_Rand>`_ and Cadmium was invented in `1817 but only 1840 as a pigment <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium>`_ as well as most of the pigments artists use.  If photography shouldn't be used then neither should all of the tools most painters use today.


Exercise Assignment
===================

Your only challenge in this exercise is to make sure you can access the larger version of this photo:

.. image:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/photos.learnartthehardway.com/basic_shapes/thumb/cube_gray_on_black.JPG
    :target: https://s3.amazonaws.com/photos.learnartthehardway.com/basic_shapes/large/cube_gray_on_black.JPG

If you can click on the image and get the larger version of it then you are ready to continue.  You should also try to right-click on it and "Save As..." so that you can save the image to your computer for later.
