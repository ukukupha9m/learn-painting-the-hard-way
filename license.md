The text and videos that accompany this course are licensed as follows:

* Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the original source from Zed A. Shaw, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
* NonCommercial — You may not use the material for commercial purposes. This includes adding advertising to the material.
* NoDerivatives — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you may not distribute the modified material. 

I reserve the right to revoke this license on anyone at any time for any reason without any explanation.  This is to  protect against changes in law or technology that the above license couldn't anticipate. I am allowed to do that because the CC licenses do not supercede copyright law and cannot advocate derivatives while also preventing derivatives.

The photographic resources included in the course are intended to be used for your artistic study and expression.  Therefore the photos are licensed [CC BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which means:

* Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
* NonCommercial — You may not use the material for commercial purposes. You may sell any paintings you make using the photos.

Some examples of things you can do with these licenses:

1. Take all of the videos and photos and host them on an internal public school or prison network to get around restricted internet access.
2. Make a painting based on one of my photos and sell it.
3. Remove objectionable material for your region, you just have to say what you removed.

Examples of things you cannot do are:

1. Use this in a university or private school.  If the students pay you, then that's commercial use.
2. Host the content on your own site and slap ads on it to make money.
3. Remove my name and claim you wrote it.
4. Put it on Amazon and charge people for it.
5. Charge any money to read it or access it.

These are only examples and not meant to be a complete list of what's allowed or not.
